> A simple Frond-End project connect to a Solidity smart contract. I used Metamask, Remix IDE and Ethers.js.A simple Frond-End project connect to a Solidity smart contract. I used Metamask, Remix IDE and Ethers.js.

## Objective
Create a simple HTML front end with buttons that can interact with smart contract functions.
The goal is to create an application capable of interacting with Ethereum's TestNet. In this case it is a diary of emotions, every time we introduce the emotion that we have felt during the day a new transaction is generated that we must approve through Metamask wallet.

## Route
The projectl takes place in 3 stages
- Create a basic HTML web page
- Create a basic Solidity smart contract
- Connect the web page with the smart contracts using Ethers.js.
